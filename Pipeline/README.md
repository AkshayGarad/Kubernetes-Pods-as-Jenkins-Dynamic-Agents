# Jenkins-Kubernetes Pipeline

This repository demonstrates the integration of Jenkins and Kubernetes to implement and manage continuous delivery pipelines. Jenkins pipelines, composed of plugins, allow for the seamless automation and integration of various stages in the software development lifecycle.

## What is Jenkins?

[Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) is an open-source automation server that enables the automation of building, testing, and deploying software projects. It provides extensive plugin support, making it highly customizable and adaptable to different environments.

## What is Kubernetes?

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is an open-source container orchestration platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a robust and scalable infrastructure for running applications in a distributed environment.

## About the Jenkins-Kubernetes Pipeline

The Jenkins-Kubernetes Pipeline in this repository demonstrates the use of a Jenkinsfile to define a pipeline with an agent running on Kubernetes. This setup enables the seamless integration of Jenkins and Kubernetes, allowing for efficient and automated continuous delivery.

## Example Jenkinsfile

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent {
        kubernetes {
            label 'mylabel'
            defaultContainer 'jnlp'
            yaml """
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    some-label: some-label-value
spec:
  containers:
  - name: maven
    image: maven:3-alpine
    command:
    - cat
    tty: true
"""
        }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn -B -DskipTests clean package'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This Jenkinsfile represents a pipeline with three stages: Build, Test, and Deploy. The Build stage compiles the code and packages it into an artifact. The Test stage runs unit tests on the code. Finally, the Deploy stage deploys the application to a Kubernetes cluster.
